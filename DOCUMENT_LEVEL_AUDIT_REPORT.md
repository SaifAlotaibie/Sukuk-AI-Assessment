## 4. Distribution Consistency Analysis

### Mean and Std of class proportions across PDFs

| Class | Global % | Mean across PDFs % | Std across PDFs % |
|-------|--------:|---------:|---------:|
| Financial Sheets | 10.6% | 11.1% | 2.4% |
| Independent Auditor's Report | 9.4% | 9.7% | 2.2% |
| Notes (Tabular) | 46.4% | 45.4% | 7.8% |
| Notes (Text) | 28.0% | 27.8% | 5.6% |
| Other Pages | 5.6% | 5.9% | 2.5% |

### PDFs deviating > 1.5 std from global distribution

| PDF | Max Z-Score | Worst Class | PDF % | Global % |
|-----|--------:|------------|------:|--------:|
| FS19 | 2.61 | Independent Auditor's Report | 3.6% | 9.4% |
| RSF8 | 2.57 | Other Pages | 11.9% | 5.6% |
| RSF3 | 2.51 | Other Pages | 11.8% | 5.6% |
| RSF4 | 2.38 | Other Pages | 11.4% | 5.6% |
| RSF7 | 2.06 | Notes (Text) | 39.5% | 28.0% |
| FS11 | 2.03 | Financial Sheets | 15.4% | 10.6% |
| FS3 | 1.93 | Financial Sheets | 15.2% | 10.6% |
| FS12 | 1.84 | Financial Sheets | 6.2% | 10.6% |
| FS4 | 1.83 | Notes (Tabular) | 32.1% | 46.4% |
| FS17 | 1.76 | Notes (Text) | 18.2% | 28.0% |
| RSF2 | 1.68 | Notes (Tabular) | 33.3% | 46.4% |
| FS22 | 1.67 | Financial Sheets | 6.7% | 10.6% |

## 5. Page Count Statistics

- **Mean pages per PDF:** 39.3
- **Median pages per PDF:** 36.5
- **Std of page counts:** 9.6
- **Smallest PDF:** FS11 (26 pages)
- **Largest PDF:** FS12 (64 pages)

## 6. Recommendation for Split Strategy

Target split ratio: **20 / 5 / 5** (train / val / test) from 30 PDFs.

Equivalent target: **20 / 5 / 5** PDFs.

### Class coverage

| Class | Present in N PDFs |
|-------|------------------:|
| Financial Sheets | 30 / 30 |
| Independent Auditor's Report | 30 / 30 |
| Notes (Tabular) | 30 / 30 |
| Notes (Text) | 30 / 30 |
| Other Pages | 30 / 30 |

### Skewed PDFs

1 PDF(s) have a single class exceeding 60% of their pages:

- **FS19** — Notes (Tabular) at 63.6%

### Small PDFs

No PDFs are too small to distort splits.

## 7. Potential Risks

- **Distribution outliers:** 13 PDF(s) deviate significantly from the global class distribution. Placing these in val/test could bias evaluation metrics.
- **Skewed PDFs:** 1 PDF(s) are dominated by a single class. If several end up in the same split, that split will be imbalanced.
